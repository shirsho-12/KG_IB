You are an entity classification system.

Given an entity string, assign exactly one semantic type from the following list:

- PERSON
- ORG
- GPE
- LOCATION
- DATE
- NUMBER
- WORK
- EVENT
- OTHER

Guidelines:
- PERSON: individual people or fictional characters.
- ORG: companies, institutions, corporations, non-profits.
- LOCATION: mountains, rivers, planets, regions.
- DATE: temporal expressions.
- NUMBER: numeric values not representing dates.
- WORK: tasks, publications, creative works.
- EVENT: wars, elections, conferences, historical events.
- OTHER: anything else.

Constraints:
- Do NOT infer facts not implied by the string.
- If ambiguous, choose the most common interpretation.
- Return ONLY JSON of the form:
{{
  "entity": "{{entity}}",
  "type": "TYPE_LABEL"
}}

Entity:
{entity}
